# Monads in C#

## Overview

Welcome to the **Monads in C#** project! ðŸŽ‰ This repository provides a practical example of how monad-like patterns can be implemented in C# to enhance code quality, modularity, and side effect management. If you've heard about monads in functional programming and wondered how they could benefit your C# projects, you're in the right place.

## What Are Monads?

Monads are a powerful concept from functional programming that helps manage transformations and side effects in a clean and predictable way. By encapsulating values and their associated operations, monads allow for clear and composable codeâ€”making even complex workflows more maintainable. In C#, we can adapt monad-like patterns to achieve similar results.

## Features

- **Transformations**: Apply a series of operations to a value while keeping your code organized.
- **Side Effect Management**: Manage logs or other side effects through each transformation without cluttering your logic.
- **Modularity**: Break down operations into composable units that can be easily tested and reused.

## Example

The code in this repository demonstrates how to implement a simple monad-like wrapper, `NumberWithLogs`, that allows you to:

1. **Wrap a Value**: Start by wrapping an initial value to create a `NumberWithLogs` instance.
2. **Apply Transformations**: Use functions like `AddOne`, `Square`, or `MultiplyByThree` to transform the value while collecting logs.
3. **Chaining Operations**: Sequentially chain multiple transformations to achieve your desired result.

Here's a brief look at the example:

```csharp
var result = RunWithLogsMultiple(WrapWithLogs(5), AddOne, Square, MultiplyByThree);
PrintResult(result);
```

In this example, we start with the value `5`, add `1`, square the result, and then multiply by `3`, all while maintaining a clear log of each step.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/monads-in-csharp.git
   ```
2. **Open the Project**
   Open the project in your favorite C# editor, such as Visual Studio or VS Code.
3. **Run the Example**
   Build and run the project to see how the transformations and logs work together.
